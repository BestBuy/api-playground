### Querying the API
* Check out our [Example Queries](queries.md) to get an idea of whats possible.
* All querystrings on GET requests are parsed using [qs](http://npmjs.com/packages/qs) to turn them into JSON.
* Nearly all the [Sequelize Operators](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/docs/querying/#operators) are supported.
  * Use `*` instead of `%` for the `$like` Operators
  * Use `$select` instead of `$attributes` for selecting specific fields
  * Use Feathers [Pagination and sorting](https://docs.feathersjs.com/databases/pagination.html) fields (`$limit, $skip, $sort`)
